tools: SUMO, Python, TraCI
summary: Analyzed network-level traffic flow using SUMO and Python.
description: >
Developed a simulation framework to derive Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) for the USF campus road network. This research helps in understanding network-level traffic dynamics and testing congestion mitigation strategies like perimeter control. The Python scripts automated simulation runs and data extraction via the TraCI interface.
